# CS361-Microserver
Hello! Let me know how it is so far and what tweaks you would like me to make, especially with mongoDB. At the moment I have it so the edits are made in the text file, but can change any of that to fit your needs. 

To ensure your environment can run it, I would make sure to have: 
- pip install Flask
- pip install requests

I chose to use Flask due to its flexibility with building python websites.

To begin using the program in one terminal run:
- microservice.py

Then, in your second terminal to update the weather run:
- update_weather.py

To send requests, at the moment the changes occur in the text file.
- add the zip code or city name
- run update_weather.py

To recieve
- once the update weather file has been prompted
- the updated information pulled from the Weather API will be in the text file


Please let me know if you have any questions!
